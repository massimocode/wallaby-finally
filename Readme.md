# Instructions
- `npm install`
- `npm test` <- do this as many times as you like, it always works
- Open editor
- Run up wallaby
- Go to example.test.js and edit some of the code inside the test as random intervals (do something that wont crash wallaby, i.e. just adding extra semi colons)
- The code should randomly report different counts, sometimes 16, sometimes 32, and something uneven numbers altogether (like 27 or something).

If you are using VSCode you can open results.txt next to the window you are editing and you will be able to see the number as the test is running.
